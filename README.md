# Prices
An app development project for personal finance management.

Ever been annoyed by fluctuating prices of freauently-bought groceries and other products, across multiple stores and multiple days? Ever wanted to be able to see exactly how a price has changed over the past few days, and which store might sell it the cheapest?

Prices is an attempt to provide that very service. An app developed using React Native, it can track the price of multiple products across multiple stores, showing a visualisation of how their prices have changed recently, and where it might be prudent to purchase them right now.

Currently only available for android.

Libraries used:
- VictoryNative
- WatermelonDB
- react-navigation
